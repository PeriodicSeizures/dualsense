# Sony DualSense Wireless Controller for PlayStation 5

This is a fork aimed at better documentation and an extension of the parent project.

For some reason, there is hardly any publicly available documentation regarding
the Dualsense controller. I have scraped through multiple sources, including:
- Google Android Dualsense driver
- DualsenseX
- Dualsense (Steam)
- This project
